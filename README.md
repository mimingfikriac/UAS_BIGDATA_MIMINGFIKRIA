Reproduce Collaborative Filtering Github:
https://github.com/fuxuemingzhu/MovieLens-Recommender.git [Reference]

So that main.py can be edited to specify the dataset and modeltype, the following new directory is created containing the same files as the github above:
https://github.com/mimingfikriac/REPRODUCE-CF.git

in this directory there is also a notebook file when trying to reproduce paper 2023, but there is an error. therefore, I switched to working on tutorials.
